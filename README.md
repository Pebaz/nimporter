## Possible Benefits

* **üêÜ Performance**: Nim compiles to C
* **üöö Distribution**: Packaging Nimporter libraries is the primary use case
* **üì¶ Invisible**: End users do not need to install Nim for source or binary
distributions
* **‚ôªÔ∏è Ecosystem**: Leverage [Python](https://pypi.org/) libraries for breadth and
    [Nim](https://nimble.directory/) libraries for performance.
* **üß£ Seamless**: Integration with existing Nim code uses the
    [Nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) library.

## Installation

```bash
# üêç From Pypi:
$ pip install nimporter

# ‚öôÔ∏è From GitHub:
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Pebaz/Nimporter
```

**Library Author Dependencies:**

 1. [Nim Compiler](<https://nim-lang.org/install.html>) (for compiling Nim
    source files)
 2. [Nimpy library](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) (installed automatically
    if `nimporter init lib` is used)
 3. [Nimporter library](https://github.com/Pebaz/nimporter) (distributed
    libraries will need access to Nimporter).

Nimporter can work seamlessly when Nim is installed via
[Choosenim](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html#installation-using-choosenim)
or manually. No additional configuration is necessary once installed since
Nimporter can find the Nim standard library and install
[Nimpy library](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) if Nimble is on your path.

**End User Dependencies:**

Users of Nimporter libraries only need Nimporter! üéâ

## Features

* Caching is supported for both Extension Modules & Extension Libraries.
* Removes the `@s` thing that the Nim compiler does to get around the 260
    character path length limit on Windows.

## Usage

Nimporter is a library that allows the seamless import & packaging of Nim
extensions for Python built with [Nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy).
Nimpy is a library that is used on the Nim side for iteroperability with
Python. All Nimporter libraries rely on Nimpy in order to expose Nim functions
to Python. Nimporter's role in this is to formalize a method of distributing
Nimpy libraries to ease the burden on library maintainers and end users so that
they do not have to even have knowledge of Nim in order to use the library.

Nimpy is a complete library by itself. For information on how to integrate Nim
and Python, look at the [Nimpy documentation](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy)
as it will be the Nim day-to-day development experience. Nimporter's role comes
into play when a library is ready to be distributed. **Nimporter handles the
entire packaging for source and binary distributions in 1 line of code.**

### Extension Modules & Extension Libraries

Extension Modules are distinct from Extension Libraries. Nimporter (not Nimpy)
makes a distinction here. However, it is of special note that distribution of
either extension type is the same (`nimporter.get_nim_extensions()`).

**Extension Libraries**

Extension Libraries are entire Nim projects exposed as a single module from the
perspective of Python. They are comprised of a single folder containing all
code and configuration for the extension. *It is important to note that they
are a concept formalized by the Nimporter project and must accept some
limitations.*

These limitations (and capabilities) are listed below:

* ‚úîÔ∏è Can have external Nim dependencies: inside the Extension Library folder,
    use a `<library name>.nimble` in order to depend upon other Nim libraries.

* ‚úîÔ∏è Can be split up into any number of Nim modules: the Extension Library
    folder can contain any desired inner folder structure.

* ‚úîÔ∏è CLI switches used by Nim & the C compiler can be customized: this can be
    useful but be cognizant about cross-platform compatibility. Remember, if
    the C compiler used by Python is different than the one used by Nim, there
    *will definitely without a doubt* be strange issues arising from this. Note
    that choosing a different C compiler may result in the `setup.py` not being
    able to compile the extension. Use a `<library name>.nim.cfg` for this use
    case.

* ‚ùå Must use folder structure known to Nimporter: the below folder structure
    is generated when `nimporter init lib` is used:

    ```
    the_library_name/
        the_library_name.nim  # Must be present
        the_library_name.nim.cfg  # Must be present even if empty
        the_library_name.nimble  # Must contain `requires "nimpy"`
    ```
**Extension Modules**

Extension Modules are the simplest form of using Nimpy libraries with existing
Python code. Once Nimporter is imported, Nimpy libraries can be directly
imported like normal Python modules. However, there are a few restrictions on
what is supported when importing a Nim module in this way. It is important to
remember that Nim compiles to C and therefore could theoretically integrate
with a build system that is extremely brittle. To completely solve this,
Nimporter disallows certain use cases that are technically possible but would
otherwise prevent widespread use of the resulting technology.

Below are the restrictions present when importing a Nim Extension Module:

* ‚ùå Cannot have any dependencies other than `Nimpy`: this is due to the fact
    that Nimporter disallows multiple `*.nimble` files strewn about in a Python
    project. Use an Extension Library for this use case.

* ‚ùå Cannot import other Nim modules in same directory: this is because there
    is no way to tell which files pertain to each extension and knowing this is
    a prerequisite to packaging the extension up for distribution.
    Additionally, Nimporter moves extensions to temporary directories during
    compilation in order to control where the Nim compiler places the resultant
    C sources.

* ‚ùå Cannot customize Nim or C compiler switches: proliferating a Python
    package with these extra files would be unsightly and it is possible to
    have two different Nim modules with custom configurations collide in
    awkward ways. If CLI configuration is required, use an Extension Library.

* ‚ùå Cannot override the C compiler used to build the extension: Although this
    practice is certainly and technically possible, it is unequivocally a bad
    decision when integrating software originating from a different compilers.
    If an expert user is in need of this capability, use an Extension Library.

Although these restrictions limit the number of possible use cases for the
integration of Nim & Python, portability, compatibility, and stability were
chosen as the guiding principles for Nimporter.

## Distribution

There are a few ways to use Nimporter to integrate Nim & Python code:

1. ü•á Library uses Nim code internally but exposes a Python API: this is the
    reason why Nimporter was built. It was built to allow Python library
    authors to use Nim to speed up their library.

2. ü•à Application uses Nim code: this is very possible but it is recommended to
    pull out the Nim code into a Python library that imports that Nim code in
    order to take advantage of the amazing distribution features of Nimporter.
    Having a separately-updatable library that the application imports greatly
    streamlines development and reduces packaging difficulty (the Python
    library dependency that imports Nim code behaves exactly like a pure-Python
    dependency).

3. ü•â Docker: this is a possible application of Nimporter, but it requires the
    use of `nimporter compile` in order to let the Docker container not have to
    contain a Nim & C compiler and to ensure that the builds are cached.

Amazingly, Nimporter allows the end user installing a library built with
Nimporter to not have to install Nim! ü•≥ This is incredible and is accomplished
by recompiling the same Nim extension to every desired platform, architecture,
and C compiler that the library is supported on. Specifically, Nimporter tells
the Nim compiler to compile the extension to C once for Windows, MacOS, and
Linux and and then bundles all of the resulting C source files into the source
distribution. At the time of the installation on the end user's machine, the
appropriate set of C source files is selected that matches the user's
environment! üôÇ

For binary distributions, this process just skips to the one set of C source
files that matches the host's environment. One binary distribution per
supported platform must then be built.

This might sound complicated but Nimporter accomplishes this by requesting that
the `setup.py` contain 1 line of code to find, compile, and bundle all of the C
files necessary to be portable across platform, architecture, and C compilers.

## Computers Actually Exist

Naturally, when integrating with native code, there are limitations to what is
possible to accomplish in certain situations. On Windows, a DLL that has been
loaded into a process cannot be deleted while it is in use. Additionally,
Windows has a path length limit of 260 characters by default (and therefore
relying on the user having disabled this limit in the system registry is not
possible). This severely limits how deep a Nim extension can be placed into a
Python package hierarchy. Furthermore, generously-named Nim extensions may fail
to compile with a message that resembles:

```
failed to open compiler generated file: ''
```

> If this message occurs, it is due to the path length limit of 260 characters.
Shorten the name of the Nim extension and make the package hierarchy shallower.
More information about the 260 character path limit can be found
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).








## About

Nimporter provides an official way to develop applications and libraries that
make use of Nim code for achieving higher performance.

It does this by providing a way to directly import Nim code and have it be
compiled at runtime. However, unlike Cython, this will not proliferate your
development environment and require adding bunches of exceptions to your
`.gitignore` file.

All artifacts are stored in their respective `__pycache__` directories. Builds
are cached so that subsequent imports do not trigger a rebuild.

Nimporter allows you to treat Nim files exactly like Python modules. This means
that namespacing is maintained for package heirarchies.

Here is a quick example of how to directly import Nim code:

**nim_math.nim**

```nim
import nimpy

proc add(a: int, b: int): int {.exportpy.} =
    return a + b
```

**Python file in same directory**

```python
# Nimporter is needed prior to importing any Nim code
import nimporter, nim_math

print(nim_math.add(2, 4))  # 6
```

Does Nimporter support single-file Nim modules only? No, Nimporter allows you to
treat an entire Nim project as a single module. The project must contain a
`.nimble` file that is used to build the project into a single library. Since
`.nimble` files are supported, this means that they can rely on Nim dependencies
and still be imported and compiled at runtime.

Have a complex build requirement that would normally entail tweaking Nim
compiler switches for each supported platform? Nimporter fully supports adding
`*.nim.cfg` or `*.nims` files for libraries that need to customize the CLI flags for any
platform seamlessly for both developing and bundling extensions.

Since Nimporter relies on [Nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) for Nim <->
Python interaction, it is a required dependency during development for every
module and library. Nimporter ensures that this is installed prior to every
compilation so that users do not have a separate `nimble install nimpy` step.

Additionally, for users who do not have access or are not interested in
installing a Nim compiler, Nimporter makes distribution effortless.

After creating an entire project with many Python and Nim modules/libraries in a
deeply-nested package heirarchy, Nimporter allows you to bundle all of this into
a single wheel just as you would with Python.

To do this, you need to add a single line to your `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup
import nimporter

setup(
    ...,

    # This is all the effort required to bundle all Nim modules/libraries
    ext_modules=nimporter.build_nim_extensions()
)
```

> Please note that the official distribution mechanism only requires a single
line of code.

Additionally, all namespaces are preserved in the built extensions and end-users
can merely install the resulting wheel containing the binary artifacts without
compiling on the target machine.

In summary, Nimporter is a library that allows you to use Nim along with Python
effortlessly by exposing two very simple APIs:

```python
import nimporter  # Required prior to any Nim module import

# 1. Import Nim code directly
import my_nim_module

# 2. Find, build, and bundle all Nim extensions automatically
nimporter.build_nim_extensions()
```

*How much simpler could it possibly get?*

## Documentation

For tutorials, advanced usage, and more, head over to the
[Wiki](<https://github.com/Pebaz/nimporter/wiki>).

Generated documentation can be found
[here](https://pebaz.github.io/nimporter/index.html).

For a bunch of little examples, look in the `examples/` directory. For more
rigorous examples testing every feature of Nimporter, you can take a look at the
files within the `tests/` directory.

## Suggested Project Structure

Although there are lots of ways that Nimporter can integrate into new and
existing applications, here is how to reduce issues arising from unstructured
usage:

```bash
Project/
    # Not required if you use `nimporter compile` but highly recommended
    setup.py
    main_package_name/
        some_file.py
        calculator.nim  # Directly imported as if it was written in Python
        some_python_package/
            something1.py
            something2.py
        # some_nim_library is used as a single Python module
        # Can be directly imported but supports dependencies and custom switches
        some_nim_library/  # Allows the use of .nim.cfg, .nims and .nimble
            some_nim_library.nimble  # Dependency info
            some_nim_file1.nim
            some_nim_file2.nim
        other_python_files.py
        other_nim_files.nim
        # Python and Nim code can coexist right next to each other
```

It is not recommended to split your Nim code and your Python code. The entire
point of Nimporter was to allow close cooperation between these two languages.

> The suggested (not imposed) project structure is to place a lone Nim file
within a Python package. If your Nim file requires any other dependencies other
than `nimpy`, you *must* place your Nim file into a folder of the same name with
a Nimble file of the same name with the dependencies listed out.

**To recap**

```bash
Project/
    (setup.py)
    main_package_name/
        some_file.py
        nim_ext_with_no_dependencies.nim
        some_other_file.py
        nim_ext_requiring_dependencies/
            # List your dependencies here
            nim_ext_requiring_dependencies.nimble
            # Must be named the same as the folder
            nim_ext_requiring_dependencies.nim
            # Can be used to customize Nim compiler switches per platform
            nim_ext_requiring_dependencies.nim.cfg
            # You can have `nim_ext_requiring_dependencies.nim` import other
            # Nim code as well
            other_necessary_nim_files.nim
```

For several examples of how to structure a project, look in the `tests/` folder.

## Compiler Switches In Pure Python

For many projects, it is convenient to set default Nim compiler switches from
the Python module importing the Nim extension. An example of this is below:

```python
import sys
import nimporter

if sys.platform == 'win32':
    nimporter.NimCompiler.NIM_CLI_ARGS = [...]
else:
    nimporter.NimCompiler.NIM_CLI_ARGS = [...]

import the_extension_module
```

By accessing `nimporter.NimCompiler.NIM_CLI_ARGS` directly, you can customize
switches prior to importing the extension module. Please note that the switches
will be used for all extension modules since Python will cache the import of
Nimporter and `NimCompiler.NIM_CLI_ARGS` is a static class field.

## Compiler Switches using `*.nim.cfg` or `*.nims`

---
**DEPRECATION NOTICE**

The use of the file `switches.py` for specifying compiler flags has been deprecated in favour of
`*.nim.cfg` or `*.nims` configuration files.

---

For Nim extension libraries only (a folder, nimble file, and Nim file of the
same name), you can place a file called `*.nim.cfg` or `*.nims` to
customize what flags get passed to the Nim compiler when it compiles that
extension. For examples on how to do this, please look in the `tests/` folder.
For documentation on the Nim compiler configuration files,
please look [here](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#compiler-usage-configuration-files).

### Increasing Speed by using the `-d:danger` flag

Since this flag is one that is desirable for Nim extension modules/libraries
alike, you can request that it be used during compilation by adding
`danger=True` to `build_nim_extensions()`. For example:

```python
from setuptools import setup
import nimporter

setup(
    ...
    ext_modules=nimporter.build_nim_extensions(danger=True)
)
```

## Distributing Libraries Using Nimporter

Nimporter supports two methods of distribution:

* Source
* Binary (Wheel)

If your library makes use of Nimporter for integrating Nim code, you will need
to include it with your dependency list. Even for binary distributions which
compile each extension to prevent compilation on the end-users machine.

### Binary Distributions

Binary (wheel) distributions allow you to forego compilation of Nim source files
on the end user's machine. This has enormous benefit and can be accomplished
very easily by adding the following line to your `setup.py` file:

```python
...
import nimporter

setup(
    ...,                                          # Keep your existing arguments
    ext_modules=nimporter.build_nim_extensions()  # Recurse+build Nim extensions
)
```

To create the binary distribution:

```bash
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

When installing via Pip, the appropriate wheel version will be selected,
downloaded, and installed, all without requiring users to install a Nim
compiler.

> Special note for Linux users: Unfortunately, PyPi will not allow you to upload
just any Linux wheel. There is a special compilation process that can be
explained [here](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux). Interestingly enough, I got
around this by simply renaming the resulting Linux build according to the
**manylinux1** naming convention. You can see my solution in the
`examples/github_actions_template.yml` file for the `build-linux` job. I expect
that there could be many downsides of using this hack but it worked for me on 2
different Linux platforms.

### Source Distributions

Source distributions allow users to bundle Nim files so that end-users can
compile them upon import just how they would during normal development.

The only supported way of providing a source distribution is to bundle the Nim
files along with the Python source files.

To do this, add these lines to your `setup.py` file:

```python
setup(
    ...,                            # Keep your existing arguments
    package_data={'': ['*.nim*']},  # Distribute *.nim & *.nim.cfg source files
    # include_package_data=True,    # <- This line won't work with package_data
    setup_requires = [
        "choosenim_install",        # Optional. Auto-installs Nim compiler
    ],
    install_requires=[
        'nimporter',                # Must depend on Nimporter
    ]
)
```

To create the source distribution:

```bash
$ python setup.py sdist
```

When installing via Pip and a binary distribution (wheel) cannot be found for a
given platform, the source distribution will be installed which will include the
bundled Nim source files. When the library is imported on the end-users's
machine, Nimporter compiles all of the Nim files as they are imported
internally which will cause a small delay to account for compilation. When the
library is subsequently imported, no compilation is necessary so imports are
extremely fast.

### Publish Build Artifacts to PyPi Automatically

Since binary distributions allow Nimporter libraries to be distributed without
requiring a Nim compiler, they are the recommended packaging type. However,
building for each platform can be tedious.

For a dead-simple way to publish Windows, MacOS, and Linux wheels to PyPi
automatically, use the `github_actions_template.yml` template found in the
`examples/` directory. This template integrates with your repository's GitHub
Actions runner to build, package, and deploy your library on Windows, MacOS, and
Linux automatically when you create a new "Release" is created.

### Usage with Docker

Nimporter can easily be used within a Docker container. To prevent the need for
a Nim compiler toolchain to be installed into the container to run Nim code, you
can pre-compile all of your extensions and copy the resulting artifacts into the
container. This process is roughly as follows:

1. Create a project that uses Python and Nim
2. Run `nimporter compile` to recursively-compile all extensions in the project
3. Ensure that in your Dockerfile that the `__pycache__` directories are
   included as they will contain the Nim shared objects as well as the Nimporter
   hash files to prevent a recompilation.

## Nimporter Command Line Interface

Nimporter provides a CLI that you can use to easily clean all cached build and
hash files from your project recursively. This can be very useful for debugging
situations arising from stale builds.

Usage example:

```bash
# Recursively removes all hashes and cached builds
$ nimporter clean
```

Additionally, the CLI can also be used like a compiler to produce a binary
extension (`.pyd` and `.so`) from a given Nim file.

```bash
# Stores build in __pycache__
# Can be imported by first importing nimporter
$ nimporter build file.nim

# Stores build in current dir
$ nimporter build file.nim --dest .

# Same 2 examples but for Nim libraries
$ nimporter build mylib
$ nimporter build mylib --dest .

# Although you can specify a Nim library's source file, please don't
$ nimporter build mylib/mylib.nim
```

The Nimporter CLI can also precompile all extensions within a project without
needing to run the project. This is useful in situations where you do not want
to package your application using a `setup.py` (such as a zip file) or for use
within Docker containers.

```bash
# Recursively compile all Nim extension modules and libraries:
$ nimporter compile
```

Finally, the CLI has provisions for quickly bundling your project into a source
or binary distribution:

```bash
# Bundles your code into a wheel (look in dist/)
$ nimporter bundle bin

# Bundles your code into a source archive (look in dist/)
$ nimporter bundle src
```

If you do not have a `setup.py` in your current directory, the CLI will generate
one for you but you will have to edit it to make sure that all of your code is
included in the resulting package. You can look
[here](https://github.com/navdeep-G/setup.py) for an excellent tutorial on how
to use `setup.py`.

## Code Quality

There are ***44 unit tests*** and ***5 integration tests*** to make sure that
Nimporter performs as advertised.

In addition, Nimporter has ***94% code coverage*** so a host of bugs have already been
caught and dealt with in a manner befitting their wretched existence.

Lastly, it has been tested and fully supported on these platforms:

* **Windows 10**
* **MacOS Mojave**
* **Linux**

> Just for fun, I got out my Windows laptop, Mac, and SSHed into a Linux box on
AWS. I then ran the test suite on all 3 platforms simultaneously. ;)

Nimporter likely works on a bunch of other platforms but I cannot justify the
time required to test them at this point.

### Running The Tests

To run these on your local machine, you will need to install a Nim compiler.

This example will assume you are cloning the GitHub reposotory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Pebaz/Nimporter
$ cd Nimporter
$ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
$ pip install .  # Nimporter is needed for the integration tests
$ pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html tests
```

## How Does Nimporter Work?

Nimporter provides essentially two capabilities:

* The ability to directly import Nim code
* The ability to bundle Python-compatible extensions for any supported platform

The way it accomplishes the ability to import Nim code is by adding two custom
importers to the Python import machinery. This is why it is required to import
Nimporter before importing any Nim code because the Python import machinery must
be amended with the custom importers.

The first one is for the ability to search and import Nim modules. When a Nim
module is found, Nimporter first looks in the `__pycache__` directory to see if
there is already a built version of the module. If there is not, it builds a new
one and stores it in the `__pycache__` directory.

If one is found, it could be stale meaning the Nim file could have been modified
since it was built. To keep track of this, a hash of the source file is also
kept in the `__pycache__` directory and is consulted whenever there is a
possibility that a stale build could be imported.

When a Nim module and a Python module have the same name and reside in the same
folder, the Python module is given precedence. *Please don't do this.*

The second custom importer has the exact same purpose of the first one except it
is used to import Nim extension libraries. A library is any folder within a
Python project that contains a `<lib name>.nim` and a `<lib name>.nimble` file.

These files mark that the folder should be treated as one unit. It also makes it
so that Nimble dependencies can be installed.

As for the second capability, Nimporter helps you bundle and distribute Nim code
as part of a binary distribution extremely easily.

The way it works is by iterating through your entire project and identifying any
Nim module and Nim library that it finds and compiling them to C using a feature
of Nim that specifically supports this.

Why compile to C? Because Python already has extensive infrastructure to support
the compilation and distribution of C extensions.

Once each Nim module and library is compiled to C, Python deals with them the
exact same way as a typical C extension. These extensions are then bundled into
the resulting binary distribution and can be uploaded to PyPi or similar.

Are source distributions supported? Yes and no. They are officially supported
for bundling the Nim source files themselves into the archive, but not the C
source files. Although the C source files would be a better alternative, the C
files generated by Nim are platform specific, so they would only be of use to
users on the same exact platform and architecture. This is why the official way
of distributing Nimporter libraries is by creating binary wheels.

## State Of The Project

I have implemented all of the features that I wanted to add at this time. I made
sure to validate the effectiveness of each feature with the unit and integration
tests. This project should be considered "done" and will receive no further
enhancements except for bug fixes and patches. You can submit a bug report on
Nimporter's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Pebaz/nimporter/issues) page.

## Contributing

Although I would not seek to add any new features to Nimporter, there may exist
certain modifications that would enhance the effectiveness of Nimporter's core
features. Pull requests are welcome, especially for fixing bugs.

## Special Thanks

Nimporter would not be possible without
[Nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy). Thank you
[Yuriy Glukhov](https://github.com/yglukhov) for making this project possible!
